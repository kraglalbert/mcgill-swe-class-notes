# Lecture 1

**Date:** January 7, 2020

* This class will be hands-on and focus on helping you bring out your ideas and how to succeed
* Over the past decade, the concept of the "lean startup" has emerged
  * Comes from lean manufacturing
  * Quickly experiment, build prototypes, minimum viable products
  * Rapidly iterate on prototypes based on early customer feedback 
  * Get rid of all the planning and just do stuff
  * Build it and they will come
* A lot of lean startups fail after their initial success
  * Too scattered, were not able to pursue one course of action
* Alternative: emphasis on strategy
  * Think of it as a scientific process
  * The lean startup does not think about strategic choices, since the emphasis is on action
* Example: Coinbase and Ripple
  * Both innovators in blockchain currency, and both at a similar company stage
  * Coinbase adopted Bitcoin as a proposed standard, and committed to serving as a one-stop shop to become the PayPal forr Bitcoin
  * Ripple innovated their own currency and protocol; a significant fraction of ripple's value depends on the overall price of RPX (and their control of the reserves)
  * Two different choices made
* A startup does not have the resources of a large company
* Startups face a high level of uncertainty
* Entrepreneurs receive conflicting advice
* Action alone is not enough, you must plan as well
  * Must have a balance of the two
* The action-based process puts too much focus on the customer; they may not always know what they want if a radical new idea is what you're thinking of
* Tech entrepreneurial strategy is the sequence of choices a founder (or their team) makes to test specific value creation and capture hypotheses when enterpreneurial experimentation requires partial commitment
* Paradox: as you make choices, if you pursue on choice you will not pursue the other choice
  * e.g. You decide to make enterprise software for banks
  * You then let go of other potential markets
* Paradoxes: 
  * How do you pick your competition and commit to a line of action?
  * How do you choose your customers?
  * How do you choose your technology?
  * How do you choose your identity?
* We will really think through all of these choices
* Obviously some problems will come up along the way
  * IP strategy
    * License? Patent?
  * Disruption strategy
    * Are you going to disrupt a particular market?
    * Dropbox disrupted by offering new users 3GB of free storage (versus the standard of 100-200MB at the time)
    * Dropbox was easy to use compared to alternatives (drag and drop into the Dropbox folder on your computer)
    * Dropbox *chose* to focus on the public instead of enterprise
  * Value chain strategy
    * The key actors required to make a successful company
  * Architectural/platform strategy
    * A **platform** is any technology that has two sides to it
      * One side: regular customers
      * Other side: complimentors (developers)
        * People that use the tools your product provides to add on it or build around it
        * The value of a platform increases with more complimentors
        * Examples: apps for iPhone, games for PS4
      * Chicken and egg problem
        * Complimentors only want to develop for a platform if there are customers, but customers only want to buy the platform if there are complimentors that build for that platform
* The 3 principles of entrepreneurship
  * Choice matters
  * The 4 choices mentioned earlier matter 
  * These 4 choices matter *together*
* Is Walmart an example of a technological entrepreneurial venture?
  * No, because Walmart's core business is not based on technology, they uses technology to improve their core business
* The four strategies can apply to any business
* Solutionism
  * Thinking about potential solutions before properly considering the root causes of a problem
