* The value proposition varies for different potential customers along the S-curve
* Because the value proposition is different for early adopters vs. early majority, Cross the Chasm requires **changing the value proposition for a given idea** (often at the expense of your early customers)
* Crossing the Chasm is facilitated through customer groups willing to embrace the product as early adopters but are also credible and engaged references for the early majority
* Companies whose initial customer choice affected their trajectory
  * Purell
    * Initially aimed at mechanics, but switched to nurses
  * Printing Machines
    * Thought customers wanted faster printing, but customers actually wanted cheaper printing

* Leap Motion in-class exercise: key challenges for each transition
  * Innovator -> Early Adopters
    * Innovators: *tech enthusiasts*
    * Early Adopters: *graphic designers*
    * Innovators may not necessarily be interested in the actual purpose of the project
      * They may just be interested in the teechnology itself
    * Showing the product has some value outside of just experimenting with it/using it for projects
    * A little bit easier to do this jump
    * There needs to be some sort of application for the early adopters, but it doesn't need to be perfect
  * Early Adopters -> Early Majority
    * Starting to appeal more to the mass market
    * Making sure the product works very well (i.e. tracks motions accurately) and that it is easy to use/set up
    * These people will (likely) be less technologically savvy 
      * They don't want to deal with bugs and long setup times
    * People will ask if the product fits into their workflow
  * Early Majority -> Late Majority
    * Switching cost, i.e. is it worth the cost of switching from their old setup to this new product
    * This demographic will be more resistant to switching
    * Make switching over as easy as possible
* There is no ideal initial customer
  * There are often multiple, equally valuable initial customers
* If you cannot say the customer that you are *not* choosing, then you are still not sure about which customer you *are* choosing
* Beachhead strategy
  * Focusing your resources on one key area, usually a smaller market segment or product category, and winning that market first before moving on to other markets
* Which customer segments did Lytro choose?
  * They targeted professional photographers, but mainly mass market (i.e. only 2 buttons)
  * The photo quality was not super high (not good enough for professionals)
  * They caught themselves in the middle
    * Not quite good enough for professionals, but too complicated for casual users
* Choosing Lytro's customer
  * An initial customer should be credible for your future customers
    * e.g. "Professionals use it, you should too!"
* Should you exploit an existing S-curve or explore a totally new one?
  * i.e. ride the wave or start your own
  * Problems can arise if you hop on a S-curve but don't properly understand your competition
