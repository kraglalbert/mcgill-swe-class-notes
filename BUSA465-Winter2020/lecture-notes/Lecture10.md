* If you want to get a patent, you typically get an IP lawyer
* Patent trolls
  * File for patents but don't do anything with them
  * Instead they look for other people that are using their patent and try to get money out of them
* Copyrights
  * Granted the right to exclude others from *copying* for a long time
  * No quid pro quo; rights granted without standardized disclosure mechanism
  * Traditional justification: protecting artistic works
  * A ban on copying precise expression
* Trademarks
  * The right to stop others from *confusing* your potential customers
  * Limitless duration as long as business is ongoing
  * More "property rights" than "intellectual", typically done later on
* Code is a special case
  * Both an idea and a way of expressing/implementing an idea
  * Can be patented *and* copyrighted
  * An algorithm can be implemented in many different ways
* An IP strategy will use *control* and *collaboration*
* The amount of licensing has been increasing over time
  * Seen as a very viable strategy for startups
* What are the benefits and costs of an IP strategy?
  * Benefits:
    * Protected from someone directly copying your idea (building a moat)
    * Don't need to create the entire value chain, you have more control of your product and can license it to others
  * Costs:
    * Need to hire lawyers and follow through with the patent/copyright process
    * Takes an average of 2 years to get a patent and the rejection rate is 50-60% (roll of the dice)
* Getty Images case
  * New strategy in the age of social media
  * In March 2014 they had a proposed plan to remove watermarks from their embeddable images
  * Under the new plan, rather than requiring payment for licensed content used in social media, users would simply have to provide a footer at the bottom of the picture with a photo credit and a link back to the Getty Images licensing page
* Getty Images strategy
  * Strengths
    * Links offer better exposure and are more navigable by users
    * Better brand recall; when someone needs to pay for a stock photo they are more likely to remember Getty Images as a brand name to go to
  * Weaknesses and Risks
    * Hard to control how people use it
    * No way to capture value
* Disruption strategy
  * Starts at the low-end, at customers whose needs are not being met
  * Should allow for continual learning so that performance improves over time
