Guest talk from Front Row Ventures

* "Navigating the startup ecosystem as a student"
* FRV backs student founders at the earliest stage with capital and a community of their peers
* Definition of VC funding
  * A type of equity financing that gives entrepreneurial or other small companies the ability to raise funding
  * Companies need to have a very high growth potential in order to be considering for VC funding
  * Long investment horizon, e.g. make your money back in 10 years

* VCs main way of making money is through IPOs
  * VCs can cash out their shares of the company that they own
* Another way is if the company they invested in gets acquired; in this case the VC gets a portion of the sale price
* Each VC has an **investment thesis**, i.e. what types of companies they will invest in
* Accelerator vs. incubator
  * Both offer training, mentoring, business support 
  * Accelerators take an already-established company and take it further
  * Incubators deal with early-stage startups
* Companies are staying private for longer than they used to
* Startup development process
  * Formation
    * Mission, Vision, Strategy
  * Validation
    * Lean Startup
    * Minimum viable product, product-market fit (will people pay for the product?)
    * A pivot may be required if there isn't good product-market fit initially
  * Growth
    * Scale Up
* The industry prefers startups with 2-3 co-founders
* Why startups?
  * Control your vision and future
  * Immediate impact
  * Juggling many roles
  * Passion-driven environment
* Why VC?
  * People-oriented asset class 
    * i.e. you invest in people
  * Deliver incredible impact by funding impactful businesses
  * Constantly meet fantastic entrepreneurs
  * Remain on the forefront of emerging technologies
* Corporate vs. Startups
  * Salary vs. Equity
  * Stability vs. Rapid Growth
  * Process vs. Creativity
  * Security vs. Passion
* Tips for fundraising for the first time
  * Reach out to your network; cold and warm introductions
  * Email the analyst or associates at the firm; they're typically the top level of the "filter"
  * Apply to multiple VCs; the first one you reach out to might not be a good fit
  * When pitching, emphasize the growth and scalability of the business
* The best way to grow your network is to be active in the ecosystem
* StartupFest—Montreal's largest startup event
* Is VC right for your startup?
  * Can you do it without venture money?
  * Are you willing to trade ownership and control in your company for a partner? An ecosystem?
  * Are you personally ambitious to build a huge commercial business that will impact many people?
  * Are you focused on getting big fast? How much capital expenditure will it take to get you from here to there?
* Institutional funding categories
  * Non-equity funding and preferred rate loans
  * Subsidies for hiring and projects
  * Tax credits
* Innovation search engine
* Why participate in/attend pitch competitions?
  * Visibility
  * Practice and feedback
  * Fast funding
  * Expanding your network
  * Essentially like Shark Tank
* A business needs to have a **moat**, i.e. it should be defensible 
  * For Uber, they have a very active marketplace
  * To protect against people stealing your idea
  * If the idea can be stolen, then there are most likely people already working on it
* StartupFest, expensive tickets but free if you volunteer
  * One week long
  * Others:
    * FounderFuel
    * Fundica Roadshow
    * Canada Fintech Forum

* Idea launching contents
  * No idea beforehand, you develop an idea at the contest
* For the project, look up VCs and look at their portfolios to find startups
  * Founders at small companies will likely be receptive to being contacted directly

* The fear of other people "finding out" about your idea holds a lot of people back
* FRV looks specifically for companies that have IP (i.e. patents)
  * Much harder for other companies to catch up if you have IP
* The biggest mistake a startup can make when choosing a VC
  * Being able to choose between VCs is already fortunate
  * Think about the marriage analogy—you want compatibility
* The team can make or break a VCs decision to invest
  * Does the team have the ability and desire to do this?
