* Today: the lean startup model (by Eric Ries)
* 70% of all startups that use the lean startup model fail
* What is the lean startup model?
  * Learn faster, code faster, measure faster
  * Build a MVP instead of trying to build the final "perfect" product
  * Continuously iterate on feedback from customers
* Why is it popular?
  * Don't need to invest a lot of resources only to find out that customer feedback is negative
  * Before the lean startup method, people thought of entrepreneurship as something based on good intuition
  * The model takes ideas from lean manufacturing (e.g. car manufacturing)
  * Also used ideas from science: make a hypothesis and test it
* Summary video
  * Build-measure-learn (continuous cycle)
  * The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build that customers want and will pay forâ€”*as quickly as possible*
  * Start by formulating a hypothesis
    * e.g. McDonald's: "Commuters want to be able to order food from their cars"
    * e.g. Spotify: "People are willing to pay monthly for being able to stream unlimited music only"
  * How to test a hypothesis?
    * Observe, don't ask
  * Waste: everything that doesn't lead to validated learning
  * A MVP should only contain the absolute minimum required to test the hypothesis
  * 3 different types of MVPs
    * Video MVP: produce a video demonstrating how the product could work
    * Concierge MVP: focusing on a single/few customers and develop the product based on their needs/feedback
    * Wizard of Oz MVP: pretend that you have developed a fancy technical solution while, behind the scenes, it's really operated by humans
* In-class exercises
  * Formulate a hypothesis for your group
    * "Restaurants want a more efficient way to provide clean restrooms for their customers"
  * Formulate an experiment/test plan for your group
    * Measure if restaurants feel that knowing when things are empty is useful
    * One-on-one meetings with managers
    * Do the video MVP and concierge MVP
    * MVP: sensors that only tell the restaurant when supplies are low (no other features)

* Key concepts

  * Validated learning
    * **The value hypothesis:** test whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once using it
    * **The growth hypothesis:** test how new customers will discover a product or service
  * Customer development and validation
  * Minimum viable product
    * Helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible
    * It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though
    * It is simply the fastest way to get through the build-measure-learn feedback loop with the *minimum* amount of effort

  * Business model canvas
    * Good tool to figure out your entire business model in more detail

* The power of the lean startup approach
  * Provides a structured way to develop core testable hypotheses about your business
  * Resolve dilemmas through data and experimentation
  * A method for avoiding paralysis
  * A community of shared learning and practice
  * A commitment to operational improvement
  * Lean startup methods are most effective when there is a meaningful way to compare outcomes in real time through A/B experimentation independent of other choices and without otherwise impacting your startup
