* IP strategy: invest in control but look to collaborate
* Disruption strategy: invest in execution but look to compete
  * Iterate quickly, try new ideas out rapidly
  * Focus is on poorly-served customers who may have lower expectations
  * Playing on a new S-curve
* Established firms have some basic weaknesses; as a startup, you want to exploit them if you choose the disruption strategy
* What happens when a startup tries to directly compete with the big players?
  * Their idea can be taken
  * Don't shout out your idea 
  * You're counting on the big players not reacting quickly and being slowed down by the inertia of a big company
  * Classic example
    * In the 90s, when the internet browser wars were going on, Netscape was boasting their idea and Microsoft beat them to market with Internet Explorer
* Think about if you'll have room to maneuver—will you have some time where the big companies won't take you seriously?
* The hidden weaknesses of established firms
  * Market inertia
    * Big firms focus on their mainstream customers and focus on their needs
    * They are slow to respond precisely because they are serving their "core customers"
  * Arrow's Replacement Effect
    * The cannibalization of existing products often justifies taking a wait-and-see approach to emerging technologies
    * If a technology may never impact the market unless we introduce it, and we only earn incremental profits from its introduction, why should we undertake a costly investment simply to "replace" our current profits?
  * Organizational inertia
    * Big decisions need to go through many different people at different levels in the company
* **A disruptive strategy requires a well-grounded hypothesis of why established firms will be slow to respond (or why you will be able to accelerate more quickly than anybody else)**
* Dos and Don'ts
  * Do...
    * Avoid detection: choose the earliest market segments to evade detection and attention from established players
    * Differentiate: choose a market position that occupies a "lonely place on the strategic frontier"
    * Customer focus: choose performance metrics & applications that meet emerging customer needs, even if they are at odds with traditional performance metrics
    * Learn & experiment: meeting these needs often involves real-time market experimentation
  * Don't...
    * Moon the giant: relentlessly focus on customers and the novel value proposition you deliver, rather than public and vivid comparisons with the established players
    * Try to rush the market S-curve: focusing on early adopters (and segments poorly served by the established technology) allows you to develop the capabilities and competities required for mainstream entry—but this takes both time and money
* Ministry of Supply case
  * Created a revolutionary new dress shirt that adapts to the wearer's body temperature to keep them more comfortable
  * Disruptive strategy
  * In terms of traditional industry metrics, they had worse performance
  * However, they defined other metrics
    * e.g. wrinkle-free
  * Targeted men because they (generally) had more *unmet needs*
  * They started off on KickStarter
    * Big risk: if your goal isn't met, you get no money
    * Allows for feedback and experimentation
    * Could not directly talk to customers, however, or observe their behaviour
* Wrap-up: Disruption strategy
  * The core of a disruption strategy is to implement quickly and stealthily so that market power and positioning are established before established firms are able to respond
  * Disruptive strategies involve a "judo" approach—turning the strength of established firm into weaknesses as they confront a new technology
    * Consumers poorly served by the established technology are ideal early adopters of the new technology
    * Performance metrics tailored to the established technology will often "blind" established firms to the promise of the disruptive innovation
* Non-tech examples of disruption
  * McDonald's: the first restaurant to eliminate waiting times and make the food ordering process fast
  * Plant-based meat: serving the under-served vegan market
* IP and Disruption are the two "main" strategies
  * The other two strategies are derived from these two
* Value chain strategy
  * For this strategy to be effective, wherever you are in the industry your position should be strong
    * i.e. it should be difficult to replace you
* Porter's Value Chain Model
  * Primary activities
    * Inbound Logistics, Operations, Outbound Logistics, Marketing & Sales, Service
  * Support activities
    * Firm Infrastructure, HR Management, Procurement, Technology
  * A value chain should lead to profit
* The case of Sun Microsystems
  * Created Java, bought by Oracle
  * Wanted to create a framework where code was able to run on every device possible
  * They tried to implement the entire value chain themselves
* Value chain strategies focus on execution and collaboration
* Benefits of the value chain strategy
  * Save lots of time
  * Compare it to the IP strategy, where it can take 2 years to get a patent
* Costs of the value chain strategy
  * Because there is no IP protection, if you don't do a good job setting up your bargaining position with your partners you are doomed
  * Completely dependent on your partners
