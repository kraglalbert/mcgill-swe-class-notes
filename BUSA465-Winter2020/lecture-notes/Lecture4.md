# Lecture 4

**Date:** January 16, 2020

* Strong ties vs. weak ties
  * Weak ties (e.g. acquaintances) are good for gathering non-redundant information
  * Strong ties are good for gathering resources
* Today's lecture: choosing your customer
* Leap Motion
  * They make a gesture-control system that allows you to interact with things like computers by only using motions with your hands
  * Who should they target as their customer?
    * In general, there is a temptation to think in terms of industries or sectors
    * Industry/sector is not the same as customer! Think in terms of categories instead (e.g. licensing, partnerships)
    * Always think about how to capture value
    * The initial customer will give feedback that can be used to improve the product
  * Due to this choice of customer, how much control does Leap maintain over its core technology and idea?
  * What are the main costs and benefits of their current approach?
* The importance of the initial customer
  * Determines what your path forward will be and who your next customer will be
  * The choices you make impact your future choices/options
* Traditional value creation and capture
  * *B*: maximum amount consumer is willing to pay for the product
  * *P*: price the consumer ultimately pays for the product
  * *C*: production cost spent on the product by the firm
  * *Q*: number of consumers who purchase the product
  * Consumer Surplus: *B – P*
  * Producer Surplus (value captured): *P – C*
  * Value created: *B – C*

* Choosing Soylent's customer
  * Software engineers, gamers, i.e. people who don't like cooking
  * They forgot about the communal aspect of eating; limiting their customer base
  * Too much patience required to get used to drinking it; customers don't see the value they get from drinking Soylent
* Key point: *always think about abstract strategies and categories!* Don't think about the customers or industries
* The Market S-Curve
  * Slow adoption at first, then rapid adoption, then tapering off as the market saturates
* Do S-curves still matter today with the rise of technology?
  * Even though the speed of diffusion might be really fast, the S-pattern can still be observed
* Customer phases
  * Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority
  * For any company, think about who would fit into each of these categories for a given product
* Crossing the chasm
  * The chasm is where functionality, reliability, etc. do not meet the needs of the mainstream 
  * What is the strategy for moving beyond early adopters?
  * A lot of companies have early customers but then fail to scale to more customers
  * Product may be too narrowly focused on a particular market
