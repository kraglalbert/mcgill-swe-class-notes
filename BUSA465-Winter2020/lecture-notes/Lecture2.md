* The action-oriented approach applies when there is one optimal path forward
* The planning-oriented approach applies when ex-ante cost-benefit analysis is possible
* Both approaches fail when an entrepreneur faces:
  * **Freedom:** multiple alternative paths for a given idea
  * **Constraint:** cannot pursue all paths at the same time
  * **Uncertainty:** cannot rank all paths using cost-benefit
  * **Learning by Commitment:** experimentation involves (partial) exploration of one path versus another
* Paradox of Entrepreneurship
  * Choosing between alternative strategies requires knowledge that can only be gained through experimentation and learning
  * However, the process of experimentation and learning inevitably results in commitment that forecloses particular strategic options
* Every company faces this paradox at some point
  * Once it comes up, how should one navigate it?
* Axioms
  * Axiom 1: Freedom
    * There is more than one potential path to create and capture value from an idea
    * Ideas != Strategy
  * Axiom 2: Constraint
    * An entrepreneur cannot pursue all paths at the same time
  * Axiom 3: Learning
    * Learning about strategic alternatives (without commitment) updates priors draws and informs the distribution of future draws
* Economies of scope vs. economies of scale
  * Scope: *a proportionate saving gained by producing two or more distinct goods, when the cost of doing so is less than that of producing each separately.*
* Starbucks
  * Initial choice: sell coffee beans directly to consumers
    * Volatile, thin margins
  * Second choice: pivot towards cafes
    * Creates a brand, customer loyalty, can sell coffee at a higher premium
  * They could have just sold coffee, but they didn't!
* Netflix
  * Why did they choose not to open a brick-and-mortar store that could compliment their online store?
    * It would harm their identity; they would be viewed as another Blockbuster with an online site
  * Why did they start producing their own content?
    * If they produce a show that becomes popular, then people can only watch it on Netflix (exclusive content)
    * Netflix has all movie/show rights, less uncertainty
  * Netflix was initially a site where people could order DVDs and then return them; they pivoted to streaming later
* For every case study, try to figure out what the core entrepreneurial idea is 

* RapidSOS
  * A company that aims to make emergency response times faster
  * Builds on top of existing architecture
  * Core idea: 9-1-1 was built for the landline era; want to leverage the power of smartphones
  * Be an "Uber for ambulances", request an ambulance through an app
  * Customers
    * Uber for ambulances
      * Pros: 
      * Cons: high degree of difficulty, difficult to verify if people are paramedics, high potential for bad PR
    * Partner with ambulance/emergency services
      * Pros: 
      * Cons: how to convince people to use the app?
    * Device manufacturers
      * Pros: goes in line with things that manufacturers are doing already, can sell to them at a large scale, stays in line with the current emergency system and builds on top of it
      * Cons: less opportunity for profit, high volatility
    * Niche customers who are traditionally poorly served
      * Pros: 
      * Cons: audience is small
  * Their initial idea was the disrupt the system, but they realized there were too many obstacles to overcome
    * Pivoted to a value chain strategy
  * Your customer choice will impact which strategy you go with
* Storm a hill
  * Value chain, the strategy to use when you want to build a **platform**
* Build a moat
  * IP, the strategy to use when you want to build a **product**
* Choosing a strategy
  * Eliminate alternatives using commitment-free analyses until you reach the paradox of entrepreneurship
  * Only after reaching this paradox does entrepreneurial strategy apply
