* Apple's success largely comes from their shift to a platform strategy
  * Used to be a linear value chain
* Types of network effects
  * Same-side (direct) effects
    * Increase in one side increases value for that same side
  * Cross-side
    * Increase in one side increases value for other side (e.g. merchants + consumers for Visa, developers + end users for Windows)
* Classic non-tech example of a platform: shopping malls
  * Need people to sell at the mall, but they need to be convinced that there will be enough customers for them to sell to (chicken and egg problem)
* Another example: advertisements in newspapers
* AirBnb case
  * What value do they bring (compared to alternatives such as Hotels.com)
  * Cheaper for the guest; hosts can rent their home (or room) if they are not using it
  * During big conferences, hotels would sell out due to too much demand
  * AirBnb's unique value came from targeting these conferences and satisfying the high demand
    * But how did they retain that value?
  * Provided insurance and protection for both hosts and guests
    * eBay was successful for the same reason
* Step 2: coring the platform
  * The process of creating a new platform where none has existed before
  * A successful platform core can provide direct value to consumers, enhances direct network effects, faciliate the development of complements, while allowing the startup to maintain control over the "core" of their technology and designs
* Coring principles
  * Calculate how adoption of one side of the platform impcats adoption on the other side on the platform
  * When side A of the platform drives adoption of the B side (but not vice versa), then the B side should be charged a positive price (subsidized)
  * Example: iPhone already had customers (side A), so Apple invested in developers (side B) to further build their platform
* Need to decide which side of the platform to focus on first
  * Should be the side which has some critical mass, and it should be used to attract the other side
  * Can't attract both at once!
  * Typically, over-invest in one side, build critical mass there, and then attract the other side
* Example: Uber
  * Paid drivers even if they weren't doing rides
* Key point: when you initially start, subsidize the side that will **create content/value**
* Step 3: tipping a platform
  * The platform value of a technology is the benefit that arises when consumers care about the number of other users
  * When a platform creates value for consumers, diffusion is driven in part by "increasing returns" and market leadership can be determined by "lock in"
  * Lock in occurs when a critical mass of consumers adopt (or are expected to adopt) a specific platform so that all future consumers can be expected to choose one architecture over alternatives
  * Network lock in: create a platform such that it would take a competitor a long time to create a network of the same size (e.g. Uber)
* AirBnb
  * Who did they expand to after conference-goers?
    * User side: travelling families
    * Hotel rooms are pretty small and not ideal for families
    * Host side: younger urban mens who have a spare room or a couch in their living rooms
    * Showed that the average money you could make through AirBnb was twice as high as regular renting
  * Followed a mix of disruption and platform strategies
    * Disruption because they targeted a low-end market and improved performance over time; big players would not take them seriously initially
  * Big shock for them: regulation
    * Didn't realize that the city would take a cut out of it
    * Didn't realize the close relationship between hotels and municipal governments
    * AirBnb was slow to react to these things
* When Uber started initially, the drivers would know what the destination is for their pickup
  * Drivers would see that and cancel some rides based on the area
  * Uber decided to change the app so that drivers couldn't see the passenger's destination until they accepted the destination
  * Also restricted access to the passenger's photo
  * AirBnb did a similar thing due to cases of discrimination on their platform
* Summary of architectural strategy
  * Orient towards competition and invest in control

* A "lemon" product is a product where you can only tell if the thing you bought is bad/good *after* using it
* Beepi case
  * Why did they fail?
    * Focused on both sides of the platform at the same time
    * Hired too many developers and not enough people to reach out to one of the sides
