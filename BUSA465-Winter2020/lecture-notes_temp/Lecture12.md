* The value chain strategy is all about being irreplaceable
* Drizly example
  * Alcohol delivery from an app
  * Partnered with local alcohol stores to deliver their inventory to customers
* Microsoft
  * Microsoft partnered with IBM to use their operating system (Microsoft DOS, Disk Operating System)
  * **Crucial:** Microsoft stipulated that they would not be in an exclusive partnership with IBM, i.e. they could partner with other companies as well
* PayPal
  * Offered customer protection—if a customer is subject to a scam or something similar, PayPal offered protection for them
  * eBay auctions were very popular at the time
* Sun Microsystems
  * Partnered with a reseller called Computervision
  * They were a 40 person company; they didn't have the resources to build an end-to-end value chain
  * While the contract allowed Computervision free access to the technology and the ability to tweak things as they chose, Computervision was unable to match Sun's day-to-day technical expertise and ultimately ended up ceding significant control to Sun over design and even manufacturing specs
* Benefits of the value chain strategy
  * Take advantage of the existing players in the value chain; assuming you can find a place in the chain, you can take advantage of existing customers
  * Whoever you partner with, their competitive advantage spills over to you as well
    * Risk: the company can squeeze you after the contract is signed
* Costs of the value chain strategy
  * Less control of your company/product
  * Must play your role well or you are at risk of getting replaced
* Value chain strategy: summary
  * Premises value capture on integrating a novel idea into an established value chain
  * The core of a value chain strategy is to:
    * Choose partners and the degree of value chain exclusivity to enhance your ability to retain bargaining powe within the value chain
    * Choose to **ration access and resources** in order to establish sizable bargaining power within the value chain
* Madaket Health case
  * They try to ease the friction of healthcare providers setting up payments
  * "Madaket’s platform streamlines the complicated, slow process of managing provider data, from initial enrollment through regular recredentialing"
  * Who did they partner with?
    * Partnered with a company called Pioneer (revenue cycle management company) which already had partnerships with hospital IT teams
  * How did they capture value?
    * Partnered with other types of revenue cycle management companies
    * Physicians don't like change—Madaket created a 2-year contract which effectively made the physicians depend on them
* Presentation #2
  * **Idea:** has anything changed?
  * **Customer choice:** has it changed?
  * **Tech choice:** play within an existing technological S-curve or attempt to create a new S-curve?
  * **Competition choice: **who do you choose as your competitors and why?
  * **Identity choice:** state your purpose as a company, how does your identity derive from that purpose?
  * **Entrepreneurial strategy:** what will be your dominant entrepreneurial strategy? Will you use a combination of them, and if so, why?
  * Articulate your value proposition, i.e. how are you going to create as well as capture value

* Platform/architectural strategy
  * Trying to orchestrate an ecosystem, not just get customers
  * Not just trying to create a product; trying to create another layer on top
* What are platforms?
  * Developed by one or several firms, and which serve as foundations upon which other firms build complementary products, services or technologies (e.g. App Store, Xbox)
  * A business ecosystem that matches buyers with suppliers, who transact directly with each other using system resources (e.g. Uber, Amazon, eBay)
* Why are platforms successful?
  * Network effects: the value of the platform increases as more users come onto the platform
    * Classic examples: the telephone, fax machines, e-mail
  * It's not about the technology itself, it's about how many people use it
* A two-sided platform has four network effects
  * A *same-side* effect for each side, i.e. preference regarding number of other users on own side
    * Positive examples: player-to-player contact in Xbox games, end-user PDF sharing
    * Negative examples: busy fax lines and telephone connections
  * A *cross-side* effect for each side
    * Positive examples: merchants and consumers for Visa, developers and end-users for windows
    * Negative examples: 
* A platform model played a big part in the success of the iPod
* The biggest challenge for a platform: the chicken and egg problem
  * Solution: fake it till you make it
