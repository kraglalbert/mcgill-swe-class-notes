# Lecture 9

**Date:** February 4, 2020

* For group project
  * Do competitive research, i.e. has the idea been done before? Did it succeed or fail? Why?
* By deselecting a customer, you deselect someone that is equally likely to adopt your product
  * You deselect them because they present some disadvantages compared to alternative choices
* Choose your competition (today's lecture)
* Two dimensions for choosing with whom and how to compete
  * Collaborate vs. compete
  * Control vs. execution
* Neither approach is necessarily better
* Dolby Digital is an example of a company that took the *collaboration* approach
* Benefits of collaboration
  * Enhancing value creation through partnerships
  * Leveraging existing capabilities and accessing existing customers
  * Reducing competitive pressure
* Benefits of competition

* Control vs. execution
  * Arrow's disclosure problem
    * Figuring out the price for an idea requires information which instrinsically reduces its value
    * You have to reveal some information about the idea
    * Ideas can be easily copied
* Benefits of control
  * Enhancing the potential for value capture
  * Anchoring the identity of the organization
  * Creating a foundation for sustainable competitive advantage
* Benefits of execution
  * Speed
  * Enhancing the potential for value creation
  * Adapting through learning and experimentation
  * Building capabilities tailored to evolving customer needs
* If something is very technologically-driven or you feel that people could replicate the idea easily if you expose it, you should go with the control approach
* Avatech case
  * Value proposition: instead of trying to provide solutions after an avalanche has already happened, they wanted to try and prevent people from being affected by them
  * They chose to partner with outdoor retailers to sell to consumers via a middleman
  * They tried to both compete and collaborate
    * They collaborated with outdoor retail chains
  * Went with control first and then execution
* Summary of steps
  * Choose your customer
  * Choose your technology
  * Choose your competition
  * Up next: choosing your strategy
* Strategies
  * IP Strategy
  * Architecture Strategy
  * Value chain Strategy
  * Disruption Strategy
* Creating a value chain (value chain strategy) incurs higher costs up-front but can have greater potential for profit in the long run
* IP Strategy
  * Formal IP
    * Patents
    * Copyright
    * Trademarks
  * Technology and product design
  * Contracts
    * Trade secrets
    * Non-compete agreements (becoming less common)
* Patents
  * Core concept
    * Innovation is risky
    * If there is no way for entities to benefit from innovation, then the incentive to innovate is minimal
  * Quid pro quo
    * Right to exclude in exchange for disclosure
    * 20 year patent term from date of filing (with caveats)
  * Standard for patentability
    * Non-obviousness (to someone schooled in the art)
    * Novelty (beyond what is already invented)
    * Utility (a potentially useful description)
  * Specialized examiners have much discretion (and no explicit penalties for mistakes)
