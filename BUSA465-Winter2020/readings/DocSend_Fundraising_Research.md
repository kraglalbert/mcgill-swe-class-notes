# DocSend Fundaising Research

* DocSend conducted a study where they looked at 200 startups that did Seed and Series A funding rounds
  * Altogether, these companies raised more than $360 million
* Main findings for companies doing a Seed round:
  * On average:
    * 58 investors contacted
    * 40 investor meetings
    * $1.3 million in capital raised
    * 12.5 weeks to close
    * 19.2 pages in slide deck
    * 3:44 average visit time
* Seven actionable takeaways
  1. Keep your deck to 20 pages or less
  2. Raising seed funding will take longer than you think. Don't start to dispair until you've been at it for a few months
  3. Try to raise from a seed firm before going to angels. Firms will give you more money and in less time with fewer meetings
  4. More meetings does not equal more money. Focus on quality over quantity
  5. You'll likely need to contact 20-30 investors (but not hundreds)
  6. Spend time on your deck. Specifically, make sure that your team slide looks awesome. If you include a financial slide, which is optional, remember that it'll be your most viewed
  7. Don't list your deal terms in your deck. Deliver them in person. The terms can vary by investor

* The longest successful round took 40 weeks to close
* Companies that failed to get funds failed after an average of 6.7 weeks
  * They may have failed due to lack of patience
* Create a list of 20-30 investors you feel would be particularly interested in your pitch
* Angels
  * Pros: 
    * Typically operators, so they can relate and have a personal interest in your project. Because you'll have a few angels in your round, you'll have a sizable support group behind you
  * Cons:
    * Angels have busy lives and fluctuating funds, so you may not always be able to rely on them for the money and support you need. You also need to sell to more of them for a round
* Seed Firms
  * Pros:
    * These firms have professional, savvy investors. The firms invest more, so they have a greater financial interest in seeing you succeed. Firms also have more money to give later if you need it
  * Cons:
    * Firms may try to control your business decisions, and they aren't always qualified to give you the best advice. Firms also see a lot of deals, so it's hard to get their attention
* Seed firms fund roughly 1,500 startups a year while angels fund around 50,000
  * Seed firms invest in 1 of every 400 companies they consider
  * Angels invest in 1 out of every 40
* Series A rounds are much less common than Seed rounds
  * There are 9 Seed rounds for every Series A
* Series A key facts
  * 9.6 weeks on average (24 percent shorter)
  * 26 investors contacted (vs. 58 for Seed)
  * 30 investor meetings (vs. 40 for Seed)
  * $8 million raised on average (vs. \$1.3 million raised)
