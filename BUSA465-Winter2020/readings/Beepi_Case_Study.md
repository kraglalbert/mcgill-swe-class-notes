# Beepi Case Study

* Used car marketplace startup
* Made history as the largest funding raise on AngelList Syndicates
* Looking to expand to San Diego, at which point they would cover essentially all of California
* Ale (one of the co-founders of the company) bought a used car when he moved to Boston but had lots of issues with it breaking down
  * Eventually took it to court with the dealer and won, getting his money back
  * Pain points: "disappointment, frustration and cash hemorrhage"
* The used car market in the US (worth $370 billion) represents almost half of all national automobile sales
* By going completely online, they could eliminate the high up-front costs of a brick-and-mortar operation
* One potential approach was to focus on big data and analytics
  * Even though existing players such as KBB and Edmunds provided average sale prices for cars, there was more potential
  * Using proprietary data and an algorithmic approach towards pricing, Beepi could pioneer a more efficient used car market
  * They could see demand from different cities and see how demand differs by region
* A second approach involved helping existing dealers make the "digital leap"
  * Most dealerships had little online presence or hosted clunky, outdated sites
  * Beepi could provide a slick, centralized interface for users to browse, book test-drives and even buy used cars
  * Since the actual dealers would be the ones to finalize a purchase, Beepi could avoid having to go through the regulatory requirements to become a licensed user car retailer
* A third approach involved helping customers who faced particular pain points with existing options for buying used cars
  * Some people may feel uncomfortable getting into a car with a stranger for a test-drive, or they may feel like they do not have enough knowledge to properly assess a vehicle
  * Could build a concierge service where Beepi would do the inspections and negotiations on thei behalf
* Finally, they a new peer-to-peer online marketplace and establish themselves as they key trusted intermediary
  * Buyers and sellers could interact directly with Beepi rather than with each other
    * Eliminate concerns about safety, as well as other hassles of vehicle inspections, payment transfers and title transfer paperwork
  * Could also provide additional services such as car cleaning and waxing, as well as the physical transportation of the car from the seller to the buyer
* Their options for funding were:
  * Try and raise money immediately pre-launch, before they had customers or revenue
  * Start operating without any VC backing, get some traction and paying customers, and then raise money
* They ultimately chose to be an online market intermediary who would invest in developing an unparalled reputation for reliability and consistency
* The sell side
  * Prospective sellers would look up their car's model and year to see the price that Beepi is willing to pay for it
  * Set range of prices depending on the condition of the car
  * Beepi guaranteed that their price would be at least $1000 higher compared to how much a used car dealership would pay
  * Sellers could then choose a time and date for a certified Beepi inspector to come by and check their car
  * Once the car is sold, Beepi facilitates title transfer, all other paperwork, and final payment to the seller
  * A Beepi inspector comes by when the car is sold to give it some more aesthetic improvements (e.g. car wash or wax)
  * Beepi guarantees that it will sell all vehicles within 30 days
* The buy side
  * Buyers would be offered a non-negotiable price that is guaranteed to be lower than the industry average, eliminating haggling from the process
  * Importantly, Beepi would only feature cars in excellent working condition that were certified by a Beepi agent, thus eliminating the need for test driving the car
    * To reinforce this feature, Beepi offers the name, credentials and contact info of the inspector so that buyers can ask them questions directly
  * Buyers have up to 10 days to return the car (free of charge)
* They chose to raise external capital prior to launch
  * Raising capital before traction was not easy for them
  * Everybody agreed the idea was great, but they wanted to see execution
* Beepi inspectors were not contractors, but rather "real" full-time employees with benefits, perks and equity
  * Also offer a direct channel for communication and feedback with Beepi customers

### Follow-Up (TechCrunch, 2017)

* "Beepi was a textbook case of a startup with a good idea, but bad execution"
* Ultimately the company was run poorly
* Had been valued as high as $560 million when it had 300 employees, raising money from 35 investors
  * Beepi was burning through almost $7 million a month
  * A large part of their burn was going to grossly high salaries and many expenses that showed the company was not economizing
    * e.g. $10,000 sofa for the executives' private conference room, paying for phone and car expenses for the founders' significant others
  * "There was a definite abuse of funds"
* The co-founders were very hands on, to a fault
  * Lots of micromanaging, and they were also very mercurial and hard to predict
* Eventually ran out of money in January 2017, and two deals to sell the company both fell through
  * The company was "sold for parts"
* Beepi may have raised too much money too soon
  * One investor in the startup said that the founders were too aggressive in pushing for higher valuations
  * "Entrepreneurs should not always be raising at too high of a price because it sets you up for failure"
