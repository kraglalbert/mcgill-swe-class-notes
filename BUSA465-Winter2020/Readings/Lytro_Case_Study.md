# Lytro Case Study

* Lytro released a new kind of camera in February 2012 that uses light fields to take photos
  * From a technical standpoint this was seen as revolutionary, since this format can allows users to do things like edit exposure, focus, etc. *after* the photo has already been taken
* Though the product was revolutionary from a technical standpoint, it did not see much appeal from the mass market
  * Certain tech reviewers lauded the product, however
* The company's future (at the time of writing, 2013) is uncertain, and they have several options that they could pursue
* Their options include:
  * Focusing on a more advanced version of their current camera (presumably with more features)
  * Bringing a new camera to market that would be aimed at professional photographers
  * Abandoning the digital images market entirely and focusing on video and VR applications
* See Lecture 5 for some class discussion notes
