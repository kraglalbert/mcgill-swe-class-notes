# Modelling with UML

* A model is used to:
  * Help understand complex problems/solutions
  * Communicate information about the problem/solution
  * Guide implementation (especially in software)
* Qualities of a good model
  * Abstract
  * Accurate
  * Predictive
  * Understandable
  * Inexpensive
* Models do not need to be fully detailed
* Models should not restrict system scope
* To find crosscutting (i.e. repetition) in requirements, look for terms of concepts that are mentioned in more than one location
  * Separate each of these concepts into a section of their own
* State machines are popular for describing the lifecycle of documents and other artifacts
* Activity diagrams
  * Describe the behaviour of a system as a flow of activities
