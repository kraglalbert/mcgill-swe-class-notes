# Inception

* Problem analysis
  * Goal: to gain a better understanding of the problem being solved before development begins
    * Identify root cause, stakeholders and their needs/problems, and the solution boundary 
  * Uses business requirements obtained from stakeholders
  * Results:
    * Product vision
    * Product scope

* Business requirements
  * Business opportunity
  * Business objective and success criteria
    * Business benefits
    * How success will be measured
  * Business risks
  * These are modelled with goals (goal relational language)
  * Helps stakeholders agree on requirements
* Problem statements can be made for root cause problems
* Problem statement example:
  * "The problem of *W* affects *X*, the impact of which is *Y*. A successful solution would be *Z*"

* **Product vision:** describes what the product is and what it could eventually become
* **Project scope:** identifies which portion of the ultimate long-term product will be addressed by the current project
* The product vision may apply to many projects
  * Evolves slowly (i.e. in years)
* The product scope focuses on one project
  * Important to the project manager
  * More dynamic than the vision
  * Can be part of a requirements document

* Requirements focus on what is needed in order for the product to meet business objectives
  * Many rapid changes

* A **context diagram** is a graphical representation of:
  * The boundary between the work and external entities
  * The information flows between them
  * Work: software, hardware and human components
  * External entities: users or interacting systems
