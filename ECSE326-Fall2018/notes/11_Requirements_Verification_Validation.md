# Requirements Verification and Validation

* Verification: are we building the product right?
* Validation: are we building the right product?
* Requirements analysis works with raw, incomplete requirements that are elicited from stakeholders
  * Emphasis on "we have the right requirements"
* Requirements V&V works with negotiated and agreed domain requirements
  * Emphasis on "we have the right requirements well done"
* Some V&V techniques:
  * Simple checks
  * Prototyping
  * Functional test design
  * Formal V&V
  * Reviews and inspections
* Simple checks
  * Given the requirements document, verify that all elicitation notes are covered adequately
  * Completeness and consistency checks
  * Verify that the requirements are well-written

* Prototyping
  * Excellent for validation by users and customers
* Functional test design
  * Tests can (and should) be derived from the requirements specification
  * e.g. TDD, Agile development
* Formal V&V
  * Simulations
  * Testing
  * Completeness changing
  * Consistency checking
  * Refinement checking
  * Model checking
  * Theorem proving
* **Model checking** is a technique that checks automatically whether a state machine satisfies a temporal logic property
* Reviews and inspections
  * A group of people (often semi-outsiders) read and analyze requirements
  * Look for potential problems, meet to discuss the problems, and agree on action items
  * This is a widely-used technique
  * Can be expensive
* Types of reviews and inspections
  * Reading and approval (sign-offs)
  * Walkthroughs
    * Author guides audience through the project
  * Active reviews
  * Formal inspections
    * An inspection meeting is like a brainstorming session to identify problems
    * Re-inspection if more than 5% of the document changes
    * Critique the work, not the author/employee
* Typical requirements issues
  * The requirement needs to be clarified
  * Missing information
  * Conflict with other requirements
  * Unrealistic

* Requirements review has checklists
* Software fault tree
  * Start with an undesirable software event, then determine all the ways it could happen
